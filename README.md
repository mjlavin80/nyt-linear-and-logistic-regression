# Instructions

Note: I have only tested this code on Python 3 on my mac. Python 2 and/or windows users may need to make edits.

1. Git clone the repo
2. Use terminal commands to change directory to the folder "nyt-linear-and-logistic-regression"
3. Activate any virtual environment if you are using one 
4. Install all Python dependencies ... numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc. (if you have anaconda, you should have all libraries already. Otherwise, `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` should work) 
5. From the "nyt-linear-and-logistic-regression" folder location, run `jupyter notebook`
6. When the jupyter notebook instance loads in your web browser, click on the `Code-Blocks-for-Lesson.ipynb` file
7. Click `Cell > Run All` or run each cell in sequence
